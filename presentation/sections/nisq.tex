    \begin{itemize}
        \item Near term devices
        \item Few hundred qubits expected
        \item Not large enough to do error checking and correction
        \item Low coherence times
    \end{itemize}

    These properties leave devices manufacturable in the forseeable future
    unable to live up to the `quantum hype', atleast in a purist's mind.

    What are NISQ devices good for then?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Computations resilient to noise
        \item Computations with low processing times
    \end{itemize}

    This suggests, rather than using these devices for independent computation,
    perhaps it's better to use them to run subroutines.

    Any actual unicorns to speak of?
