In this report we reviewed Variational Quantum Algorithms and classification
theory, finally establishing error bounds on the output of a Quantum Support
Vector Machine supported by a VQA backend. We are continuing work on studying
the landscape generated by the Dynamical Lie Algebra and consequently to pull
back the error bounds to the unitary group to propose bounds generalized from
the QSVM to the Parametrized Quantum Circuit. Next steps involve literature
review and study of compact group measures and the information content of those
descriptions. With a more formalized mathematical description of the landscaping
maps in terms of measure theory, the problem of reporting error bounds at each
step of the computation is expected to be tractable.
