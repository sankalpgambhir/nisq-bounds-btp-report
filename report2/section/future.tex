In this report we reviewed Variational Quantum Algorithms and optimization
theory, finally establishing bounds on the expressiveness achievable by choice
of ansatz in a VQA. 
%
These bounds fundamentally limit the set of problems finding whose solutions
within the VQA framework may be tractable in practice.
%
We are continuing work on studying specific ansatzes and the limits imposed on
them to develop a precise idea of the intractable problems. The effects of this
bound on the possibility of achieving a quantum advantage on NISQ systems
remains unclear, and is a subject for further study.
%
A more mathematically precise discussion of the landscapes generated within the
framework, and a study of their transformations is expected to allow a more
through understanding of their limits at each stage.
